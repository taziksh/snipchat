# Snipchat

## Introduction
Snipchat returns audio snippets based on a given input phrase.

## Style
- Use single quotes by default, and double quotes for string literals
- For functions that mutate arguments, use verb conjugation (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/8211949/8773953) 
- Classes follow PascalCase, but note that we maintain proper nouns e.g. 'YouTube', versus 'Youtube', 'AZLyrics' vs 'Azlyrics'

## Wishlist
- [] Search playlists. Example use case: "breakdown breakdown" to find JJBA IV op
